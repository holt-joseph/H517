            <h2>Process</h2>

            <p>I began by breaking down the features required for each grade threshold in this project.</p>
            <p>Originally, they were on one list, but I realized part of the way through that it would be better to divide them by map and graph requirements.</p>

            <p>Now with a better idea of what features the entire application would have, I designed my first draft of the project.</p>
            <p>I used Microsoft Paint (quick and easy to iterate) to determine what divisions would be on the web page.</p>

            <img width="400" height="225" src="media/Project01_DesignMap02.jpg">

            <p>I decided against this first draft, as because the map would be square, I wanted to minimize wasted space on that view.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, I created my second draft, aiming to limit empty white space on the map view.</p>

            <img width="400" height="225" src="media/Project01_DesignMap01.jpg">

            <p>The final design takes the design map and primarily increases the width of the graph area.</p>
            <p>Another change is that the map controls and legend were moved to the right of the map, in the map area.</p>
            <p>A footer area was added to the bottom to support the about links.</p>
